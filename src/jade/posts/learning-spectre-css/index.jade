	p I came across the minimalist #[span.highlight Spectre.css] while reading the CSS Weekly newsletter, and at first I thought "not #[em another] CSS framework&hellip;", but after looking through the documentation, it's a very promising system.

	blockquote Spectre.css is a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework for faster and extensible development. #[cite &mdash;&nbsp;#[a(href="http://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/" target="_blank") picturepan2]]

			p This CSS system works with modern attributes and values, utilizing #[code display: flex] for the grid system, design that follows the #[em zeitgeist] of web design and development.

	p But don't take my word for it, go check it out for yourself! The download is a tiny 38kb (!), and fits into any style site very well. (as you can see, I used it on this site.) Drop it in and have fun with it.

	p Happy coding!
